## Onlne certificate examination
*EMAX-IT Informationstechnologie GmbH (Mayrwiesstrasse 15, 5300 Hallwang, Österreich)* will do the training and 
the certification examination will be conducted by a subcontractor of EMAX IT (Certible OG, Löwelstraße 20/2-3, 1010 Wien, Österreich).
 
Registration for the exam:
•	Will be done by EMAX IT. 
•	The participants will get a mail from the exam provider (Certible OG) and has than arrange the exam date and time directly with the provider.

## How to prepare
**Review the iSAQB syllabus**: The iSAQB provides a detailed syllabus for the CPSA certification program, which outlines the topics and concepts that will be covered on the exam. Reviewing the syllabus can help you identify areas where you may need to focus your study.

**Review the CPSA training course**: iSAQB-approved training courses are available from various providers and are designed to prepare candidates for the CPSA certification exam. These courses cover the material in the iSAQB syllabus and provide hands-on experience with software architecture tools and techniques.

**Practice with sample questions**: iSAQB provides sample questions on their website that are similar in format and difficulty to the questions on the CPSA certification exam. Practicing with these questions can help you become familiar with the types of questions you can expect to see on the exam and can help you identify areas where you need to improve your knowledge.

**Read relevant literature**: There are many books and articles on software architecture that can help you deepen your understanding of the concepts and principles covered in the CPSA certification exam. Some popular books on software architecture include "Software Architecture in Practice" by Len Bass, Paul Clements, and Rick Kazman, and "Documenting Software Architectures: Views and Beyond" by Paul Clements, Felix Bachmann, Len Bass, David Garlan, James Ivers, Reed Little, Robert Nord, and Judith Stafford.

**Join a study group or forum**: Joining a study group or online forum can provide you with support and guidance as you prepare for the CPSA certification exam. You can share your experiences and learn from others who are also preparing for the exam.
